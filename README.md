Also useful for prototyping other circuits.

Required KiCad dependency:

https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/gsg-kicad-lib

If you are using git, the preferred way to install gsg-kicad-lib is to use the
submodule:

```
git submodule init && git submodule update
```

## Solderless Breadboard Compatibility

Daffodil provides a solderless breadboard plus a small solderable breadboard area for through-hole prototyping.

It is designed for the [SparkFun Electronics PRT-12047 solderless breadboard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12047). The breadboard has an adhesive pad on the bottom that can be stuck onto Daffodil.  There is no electrical connection through the bottom of the breadboard.

Other solderless breadboards that fit are: Pololu 1490; Parallax 700-00012

## Pin Usage

All pins on J1, J2, and J7 are available.
